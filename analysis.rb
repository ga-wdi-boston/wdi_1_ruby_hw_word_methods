# This will give you the contents of the `sample.txt` file as one big string
sample_text = File.read('sample.txt')


# 1. Method that splits a string (e.g. the text from `sample.txt`) into an array of normalized words. "Normalized" here means that the words should be all lowercase and scrubbed of any punctuation such as periods or parentheses.


# 2. Method that takes a string and returns an array of all *unique* words in it, ignoring punctuation and capitalization differences.


# 3. Method that counts how many words are in a string. This method should also provide the *option* to count unique words instead of total words.


# 4. Method that takes a string and returns a hash where the keys are normalized words, and the values are integers representing how many times that word occurs in the string.


# 5. Method that finds the most common word in a string that is longer than a particular "length threshold". The threshold should be optional, and default to 3 characters (i.e. words of 3 characters or less will not be considered). It's up to you how to handle multiple words being "tied" for most common.


# * Write a method that finds the length of the longest word in a string, and returns an array of all unique words in the string that are that length.
